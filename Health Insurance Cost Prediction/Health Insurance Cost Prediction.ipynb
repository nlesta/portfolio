The root-mean-square error (RMSE) stands at 6534.66, reflecting the average magnitude of the residuals. Examining the variable coefficients, being a smoker has a substantial positive impact on predicted charges, contributing 24070.41 to the estimate. Other influential variables include region (specifically northeast) and BMI. The intercept, representing the estimated charges when all predictors are zero, is -25516.54."
